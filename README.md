# Advanced applications of neural networks (deep learning) @ CogSci UW 2021/2022 winter

## Basics
The class takes place on Mondays at 15:30 on Google Meet (the link is sent out before each class). For class we use Jupyter Notebook, which can be run on Google Colab. The notebooks look best locally (GitHub does not render some things), but should also be fine in Google Colab. If imports don't work on Google Colab, do the following in a cell at the top:
```
!git clone https://github.com/kgalias/aann2021winter.git
%cd aann2021winter
```

## Attendance
Attendance is not mandatory (and due to the online nature of the course will not be checked). However, doing the tasks in the notebooks is (more on that below).

## Grading
Your final grade will be based on completing the tasks in the notebooks (50%) and a final project (50%). The final grade percentages are as follows:
- 0-49%: 2
- 50-59%: 3
- 60-69%: 3.5
- 70-79%: 4
- 80-89%: 4.5
- 90-100%: 5

### Tasks
The solved notebooks have to be handed in until the day of the next class at 12:00 either via sharing by Google Drive or as a ~~forked private~~ GitHub repo (apparently this is harder than I thought; here's one way: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10065526/github-how-to-make-a-fork-of-public-repository-private; you can either do this or just clone the repository without making it a fork). Your solutions have to be private to prevent plagiarism from others.

### Project
The project will be graded based on compliance with the chosen topic, quality of the code, novelty of the idea, and presentation of the results. Details (along with proposed project topics) are in a separate document.
